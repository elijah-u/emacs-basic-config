#+TITLE: Basic(-ish) Emacs Config

** Background

Not the most basic, but not a full-blown config either. Just enough goodness to try to have emacs in a useful state.

** Packages used:
- =elpaca= for package management
- =evil= for sane keybindings
- =magit= for git goodness
- =which-key= for all the other key combos 
- =no-littering= to reduce the files emacs throws everywhere
- =key-chord=  for jk/kj exit to normal state because sometimes esc is too slow
- =general= probably overkill, but for easier key mapping

  
** Possibly worth adding:
- orderless
- marginalia
- embark
- consult
- vertico
- corfu
- evil-org
- vterm
- ace-window
  
** other possibly useful/needed bits

*** fix for issue with upgrading =seq=
